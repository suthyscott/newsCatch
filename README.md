newsCatch is an app to let users view a text analysis of news articles.

The app is laid out in a very simple format. Once you have registered or logged in a list of top headlines will be displayed, each of which you can save or view. Saving an article will add it to your account so that you can view it at your descretion. Viewing it will display a description of the article, with the option to go the article's site and read the full piece. 

When viewing an article you are able to display the text analysis results: sentiment, entities, and key phrases. These will pop up from the footer. 

You can edit your account details from the My Account page. 

Enjoy catching what you need from the news!
